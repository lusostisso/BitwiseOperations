# OperacoesBitwise
Low-level programming class exercise, bitwise operations

Create a function for each operation below (the function must return the changed value):

- Sets a single bit: unsigned int setbit (unsigned int x, int bit)
- Resets a single bit: unsigned int clearbit (unsigned int x, int bit)

- Inverts the value of a single bit: unsigned int invertBit (unsigned int x, int bit)

- Returns the state of a given bit: int testBit (unsigned int x, int bit) (returns 0 or 1)

- Display number in binary
